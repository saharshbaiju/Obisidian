### Methods
Methods are basically functions in python they are set of code which can be reused easily when called.

We have used methods earlier in our codes with or without knowing for example the in the string built-in function like [[Basics#^151a8f|length ,toLowerCase() etc.]] <- ==DO CHECKOUT==

### Creating custom method
method name is normally written in lower camel case eg: `helloWorld`

Syntax 
```
returnType methodName(){
//code logic here
}
```

we should use static before returnType when declaring methods out of main class reason will be discussed afterwards.
